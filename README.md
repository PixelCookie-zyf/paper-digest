## Why This Tool

Reading papers is hard work. Especially in the LLM Agent space — since ReAct dropped in October 2022, hundreds of papers have piled up. You want to systematically read through them, but:

- Don't know where to start
- Can't tell which ones are worth reading vs. noise
- Forget the key points after reading
- Switching between Chinese and English is exhausting

This tool solves all of that.

## How It Works

```
python main.py
```

That's it. The tool will:

1. **Search** — Query arXiv from the ReAct era (2022-10) onward, oldest first
2. **Deduplicate** — Skip papers you've already read
3. **AI Screen** — MiniMax judges each paper: worth your time?
4. **Deep Read** — Download full PDF, extract complete text
5. **Summarize** — One paper at a time to MiniMax for thorough bilingual analysis
6. **Generate** — One MDX file per paper, structured and blog-ready

Run it again tomorrow — it picks up where you left off, never repeats.

## What Makes This Different

- **Chronological reading path** — Starts from foundational papers (ReAct, Toolformer...) and progresses forward. You build understanding in order, not randomly.
- **AI as your reading filter** — MiniMax screens candidates before committing to a full read. Skips the noise, keeps the signal.
- **One paper, full attention** — No batch summarization. Each paper gets the complete PDF fed to MiniMax individually for a thorough, specific summary.
- **Bilingual output** — Every section in both Chinese and English. Not machine-translated — the AI writes each language natively.
- **Incremental & resumable** — History tracking means you can run it daily/weekly and steadily work through the field.
- **Real progress visibility** — Rich terminal UI with spinners and timing for every step. You always know what's happening.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → add your MINIMAX_API_KEY

# Run
python main.py
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py                          # Default: "LLM Agent" from 2022-10
python main.py "multimodal reasoning"   # Custom topic
python main.py -n 5                     # Read 5 papers this run
python main.py --pool-size 50           # Search deeper
python main.py --start-date 2024-01-01  # Jump to a later period
python main.py --no-screen              # Skip screening, read everything
python main.py --history                # See what you've already read
```

## Configuration (.env)

```env
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_key_here           # Required
MINIMAX_BASE_URL=https://api.minimaxi.com/v1
MINIMAX_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.7
OUTPUT_DIR=output
```

## MDX Output

Each paper gets its own `.mdx` file containing:

| Section              | Description                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Paper title          | EN + ZH                        |
| One-line summary     | What it does and why it matters|
| Research problem     | What problem it addresses      |
| Abstract summary     | Motivation, method, results    |
| Core method          | Specific technical approach    |
| Model / framework    | Architecture and components    |
| Datasets             | What data, what scale          |
| Experimental setup   | Baselines, metrics, params     |
| Main results         | Key numbers and findings       |
| Innovations          | What's new                     |
| Limitations          | Shortcomings                   |
| Use cases            | Where to apply                 |
| Key takeaways        | What you should focus on       |
| Keywords             | EN + ZH                        |
